				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<br />
				This year marks the 150th celebration of Nature, however, how the army of unsung editors-in-chief
				strengthen and enrich the integrity and quality of the journal under the umbrella of its original
				mission, is understood as nominal rather than substantial yet.
				We scrutinize the chief vehicle guided by the Nature’s doctrine, when it has gone astray
				against the advancement of both science and social progress. Our findings are expected to provide
				hallmark reference to reframe extensible discussions on learned journals and scientific enterprise.

				The wholly chronological account of editors-in-chief of Nature is a faithful mirror of this
				renowned “weekly illustrated journal of science”. The scientific fame curves between 1859 and
				2008 are facsimiled according to the n-gram frequency in the Google Books Corpus, and those
				after 2008 are obtained from the Google scholar search engine due to the coverage of the Google
				Books n-gram database. Our findings indicate that Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer (red), Sir Richard
				Arman Gregory (orange), Lionel John Farnham Brimble (blue), Arthur J. V. Gale (green), Sir John
				Royden Maddox (cyan) David Dai Davies (magenta) and Philip Campbell (black) have enjoyed their
				fames and reputations during their own tenures, and collective memory of these unsung
				journalists has both a short-term and a long-term component.

				Spiral projection of similar words of “computer”. According to the historiographical records, Sir
				Richard Arman Gregory and John Royden Maddox were
				computers in their early careers. Similarities of words are computed by the cosine distances of word
				embedding vectors pre-trained on the Google Books Corpus in different years. In early years,
				“computer” is used as an occupation as many of its similar words, and in later years its meaning
				gets closed to the computer that we are familiar with today.

				Word-cloud portrayals of Sir John Royden Maddox. a and b portray the positive and negative sentiment
				words extracted from the SentiWordNet lexicon, respectively. The results show that the negative
				sentiment of these editorials is determinant. As a case in point, Maddox penned serial hard-hitting
				editorials to scold molecular biologists regarding the philosophy of molecular biology.

				The Web of Science facsimiles the patterns of issued publications in Nature and control groups of
				learned journals. In Nature’s first fifty years, the founding editor Lockyer and his assistants
				produced 2,600 weekly numbers in 103 volumes. As cutting-edge weekly journals, Nature (red) has
				survived through the world wars, along with Science (orange) and The Lancet (blue). International
				conflicts significantly inhibited the of issued publications in Nature, Science and The New England
				Journal of Medicine (green). Notably, substantial pattern shifts are observed before and after each
				editor-in-chief turnover of Nature. This finding indicates that maintaining a relatively stable
				editorial team is beneficial to the development of a scientific journal. For example, Nature has
				experienced dramatic fluctuations between 1971 and 1974, which coincided with the John Maddox’s
				venture – splitting Nature into a portfolio of Nature Physical Science, Nature New Biology and
				Nature. When Nature got back on track, molecular biologist Benjamin Lewin left Nature New Biology
				and founded Cell (gray) in January 1974. In 1975, David F. Horrobin, as founding editor, established
				a non-peer reviewed medical journal Medical Hypotheses (magenta) to challenge the peer-review
				policy. In April 1992, Geoffrey North, deputy biology editor of Nature, left Nature where he had
				worked for more than 11 years. Then he was appointed as the editor-in-chief of the biweekly
				peer-reviewed journal Current Biology (cyan), which was established in 1991.

				Topic words projection of Sir John Royden Maddox. The topic words are extracted by the latent
				Dirichlet allocation algorithm and are visualized by projecting the word embedding vectors via
				t-SNE. It is well known that Nature has many eminent advocators, including Fred Hoyle, James Watson,
				Francis Crick, Charles Darwin, and so on.

				Maddox’s eight-combo critiques upon molecular biology. Sir John Royden Maddox penned series of
				hard-hitting editorials to scold molecular biologists upon the philosophy of molecular biology from
				1983 to 1995. These eight-combo critiques, which are exemplified by highlighted contexts with
				negative sentiments here, invoked intensive arguments among scientists.
